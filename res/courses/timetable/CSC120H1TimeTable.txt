{"breadth": "The Physical and Mathematical Universes (5)", "code": "CSC120H1", "description": "An introduction to computer science for students in other sciences, with an emphasis on gaining practical skills. Introduction to programming with examples and exercises appropriate to the sciences; web programming; software tools.  Topics from: database design, considerations in numerical calculation, using UNIX/LINUX systems. At the end of this course you will be able to develop computer tools for scientific applications, such as the structuring and analysis of experimental data. With some additional preparation, you will also be ready to go on to CSC148H1.  Practical (P) sections consist of supervised work in the computer laboratory. No programming experience is necessary.\n", "title": "CompSci for Sciences", "S": {"tutorials": [["T0101", ["T3", "T4"]], ["T5101", ["T5", "T6"]]], "lectures": [{"section": "L0101", "cap": "120", "times": ["M10", "W10"], "extraCap": 0, "time": "MW10", "instructor": "Campbell"}]}, "distribution": "This is a Science course", "manualTutorialEnrolment": true, "exclusions": [" Any CSC course"]}
