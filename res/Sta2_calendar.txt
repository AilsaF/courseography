STA248H1    Statistics for Computer Scientists[36L/12T]
A survey of statistical methodology with emphasis on data analysis and applications. The topics covered include descriptive statistics, data collection and the design of experiments, univariate and multivariate design, tests of significance and confidence intervals, power, multiple regression and the analysis of variance, and count data. Students learn to use a statistical computer package as part of the course (Note: STA248H1 does not count as a distribution requirement course).

STA261H1    Probability and Statistics II[36L/12T]
A sequel to STA257H1, providing a rigorous introduction to the logical foundations of statistical inference and the practical methodology engendered. Topics include: statistical models, parameters, samples and estimates; the general concept of statistical confidence with applications to the discrete case and the construction of confidence intervals and more general regions in both the univariate and vector-valued cases; hypothesis testing; the likelihood function and its applications; time permitting: the basics of data analysis, unbiasedness, sufficiency, linear models and regression (Note: STA261H1 does not count as a distribution requirement course).
