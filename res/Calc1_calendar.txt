MAT137Y1    Calculus[72L/24T]
A conceptual approach for students with a serious interest in mathematics. Geometric and physical intuition are emphasized but some attention is also given to the theoretical foundations of calculus. Material covers first a review of trigonometric functions followed by discussion of trigonometric identities. The basic concepts of calculus: limits and continuity, the mean value and inverse function theorems, the integral, the fundamental theorem, elementary transcendental functions, Taylors theorem, sequence and series, uniform convergence and power series.

MAT157Y1    Analysis I[72L/48T]
A theoretical course in calculus; emphasizing proofs and techniques, as well as geometric and physical understanding. Trigonometric identities. Limits and continuity; least upper bounds, intermediate and extreme value theorems. Derivatives, mean value and inverse function theorems. Integrals; fundamental theorem; elementary transcendental functions. Taylors theorem; sequences and series; uniform convergence and power series.
