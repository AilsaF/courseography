Mathematical induction; correctness proofs for iterative and recursive algorithms; recurrence equations and their solutions (including the Master Theorem); introduction to automata and formal languages.  This course assumes university-level experience with proof techniques and algorithmic complexity as provided by CSC165H1.  Very strong students who already have this experience (e.g. successful completion of MAT157Y1) may consult the undergraduate office about proceeeding directly into CSC236H1.\n", "title": "Intro to Theory Comp", "prereqString": "CSC148H1/CSC150H1, CSC165H1", "F": {"tutorials": [["M11"], ["R7", "R8"]], "lectures": [{"section": "L0101", "cap": "130", "times": ["W11", "F11"], "extraCap": 0, "time": "WF11", "instructor": "Baumgartner"}, {"section": "L5101", "cap": "130", "times": ["R6"], "extraCap": 0, "time": "R6", "instructor": "Baumgartner"}]}, "S": {"tutorials": [["R5"], ["R2"], ["R5"]], "lectures": [{"section": "L0101", "cap": "125", "times": ["T4", "R4"], "extraCap": 5, "time": "TR4", "instructor": "Baumgartner"}, {"section": "L0201", "cap": "130", "times": ["T1", "R1"], "extraCap": 0, "time": "TR1", "instructor": "Baumgartner"}, {"instructor": "Baumgartner", "section": "L2003", "cap": "5", "extraCap": 0, "time": "TR4"}]}, "prereqs": [["CSC148H1", "CSC150H1"], "CSC165H1"], "distribution": "This is a Science course", "manualTutorialEnrolment": false, "exclusions": [" CSC240H1"]}
