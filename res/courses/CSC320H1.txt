{"breadth": "None", "code": "CSC320H1", "description": "Image synthesis and image analysis aimed at students with an interest in computer graphics, computer vision or the visual arts. Focus on three major topics: (1) visual computing principles - computational and mathematical methods for creating, capturing, analyzing and manipulating digital photographs (image acquisition, basic image processing, image warping, anti-aliasing); (2) digital special effects - applying these principles to create special effects found in movies and commercials; (3) visual programming - using C/C++ and OpenGL to create graphical user interfaces for synthesizing and manipulating photographs. The course requires the ability to use differential calculus in several variables and linear algebra.\n", "title": "Introduction to Visual Computing", "prereqString": "CSC209H1/(CSC207H1, proficiency in C or C++); (MAT135H1, MAT136H1)/MAT135Y1/MAT137Y1/MAT157Y1, MAT221H1/MAT223H1/MAT240H1", "prereqs": [["CSC209H1", "CSC207H1"], ["MAT135H1", "MAT135Y1", "MAT137Y1", "MAT157Y1"], ["MAT221H1", "MAT223H1", "MAT240H1"]], "distribution": "This is a Science course"}
