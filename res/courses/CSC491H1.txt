{"breadth": "The Physical and Mathematical Universes (5)", "code": "CSC491H1", "description": "This half-course gives students experience solving a substantial problem that may span several areas of Computer Science. Students will define the scope of the problem, develop a solution plan, produce a working implementation, and present their work using written, oral, and (if suitable) video reports. Class time will focus on the project, but may include some lectures. The class will be small and highly interactive. Project themes change each year. Contact the Computer Science Undergraduate Office for information about this year\u2019s topic themes,  required preparation and course enrolment procedures. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.\n", "title": "Capstone Design Project", "prereqString": "Permission of the instructor", "prereqs": ["Permission of the instructor"], "distribution": "This is a Science course"}
