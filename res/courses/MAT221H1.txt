Systems of linear equations, matrices, Gauss-Jordan elimination, subspaces, bases, orthogonal vectors and projections. Matrix inverses, kernel and range, rank-nullity theorem. Determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Cramer's rule, diagonalization. This course has strong  emphasis on building computational skills in the area of algebra. Applications to curve fitting, economics, Markov chains and cryptography.\n", "prereqs": ["High school level calculus"], "title": "Applied Linear Algebra"}
