Topics include: statistical models, parameters, samples and estimates; the general concept of statistical confidence with applications to the discrete case and the construction of confidence intervals and more general regions in both the univariate and vector-valued cases; hypothesis testing; the likelihood function and its applications; time permitting: the basics of data analysis, unbiasedness, sufficiency, linear models and regression (Note: STA261H1 does not count as a distribution requirement course).\nCorequisite: MAT235Y1/MAT237Y1/MAT257Y1, MAT223H1/MAT240H1\n", "prereqs": ["STA257H1"], "title": "Probability and Statistics II"}
