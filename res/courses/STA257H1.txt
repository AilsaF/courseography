Topics, albeit very rigorously covered, are, nevertheless, very standard introductory ones: abstract probability and expectation, discrete and continuous random variables and vectors, with the special mathematics of distribution and density functions, all realized in the special examples of ordinary statistical practice: the binomial, poisson and geometric group, and the gaussian (normal), gamma, chi-squared complex.\nCorequisite: MAT235Y1/MAT237Y1/MAT257Y1 (MAT237Y1/MAT257Y1 is strongly recommended), MAT223H1/MAT240H1\n", "prereqs": [["MAT135Y1", "MAT137Y1", ["MAT157Y1", " (MAT137Y1"], ["MAT157Y1", " is strongly recommended)"]]], "title": "Probability and Statistics I"}
