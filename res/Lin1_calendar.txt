MAT221H1    Applied Linear Algebra[36L/12T]
An application-oriented approach to linear algebra, based on calculations in standard Euclidean space. Systems of linear equations, matrices, Gausss-Jordan elimination, subspaces, bases, orthogonal vectors and projections. Matrix inverses, kernel and range, rank-nullity theorem. Determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Cramer's rule, diagonalization. This course has strong  emphasis on building computational skills in the area of algebra. Applications to curve fitting, economics, Markov chains and cryptography.
